    And now, instead of mounting barded steeds To fright the souls of fearful
    adversaries, He capers nimbly in a lady's chamber To the lascivious
    pleasing of a lute. But I, that am not shaped for sportive tricks, Nor
    made to court an amorous looking-glass; I, that am rudely stamp'd, and
    want love's majesty To strut before a wanton ambling nymph; I, that am
    curtail'd of this fair proportion.
